#Future Improvements

+ I would set up a time frame of when the cache would be invalidated

+ I would add navigation to each album if there was more data to display

+ I would add pagination to avoid downloading large chunks of data

+ I would add some connection checkers or reiterations if the connection to the api fails then try again
